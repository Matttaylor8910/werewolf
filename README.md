# Werewolf

I built a [Werewolf](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38159/ultimate-werewolf-ultimate-edition) moderator helper app.

## What is it?

Werewolf is a role-playing game similar to Mafia where players are with the werewolves, with the village, or perhaps one of the rogue roles with their own agendas. Every night several players are able to kill, save, and affect players in other way. In the daytime, everyone discusses and votes someone off to die that night. Werewolf has 30 unique roles and is a game that works really well with 11-16 players. 

## So what’s the problem?

Moderating a game where that many people have different actions in the night, and affect the gameplay throughout the day is difficult. This Werewolf app helps with picking and assigning roles to players as well as helping the game flow so the moderator is less likely to make mistakes.

## What’s next?

Werewolf is far from finished and I have several things I’d like to complete before it reaches the App Store, but it’s in active development and has a group of real beta testers in Boise, ID.

## How can I help?
